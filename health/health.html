    <h3>FOOD</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <p>
                For a 170 cm (5'7") person weighing 80 kg (176 lbs), focusing on a diet that supports both healthy weight management and muscle growth can be effective, especially if you’re training in calisthenics or an army-style regimen. This general diet plan focuses on lean muscle development, fat loss, and high energy levels. Here’s a rough breakdown:

                1. Determine Your Caloric Needs
                Maintenance Calories: For most people around your weight and height, the maintenance calorie range is approximately 2,200–2,500 calories per day, but this varies with activity level.
                Calorie Deficit (if weight loss is a goal): Aim to eat around 1,800–2,000 calories to lose about 0.5 kg per week, a safe and sustainable rate.
                Caloric Surplus (for muscle gain): If your goal is to gain lean muscle, aim for about 2,500–2,700 calories daily, with a focus on higher protein.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Macronutrient Breakdown
                Protein: 1.6–2.2 grams per kg of body weight (128–176 grams daily for 80 kg). Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth.
                Carbohydrates: 40–50% of daily calories (about 180–250 grams). Complex carbs provide sustained energy.
                Fats: 20–30% of daily calories (about 60–80 grams). Healthy fats are crucial for hormone regulation, especially in active individuals.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Meal Composition
                High Protein Sources: Lean meats (chicken, turkey), fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, tofu, legumes.
                Complex Carbohydrates: Oats, brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, whole-grain bread, and pasta.
                Healthy Fats: Avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish (like salmon or sardines).
                Vegetables and Fruits: Aim for a variety of colors to ensure a broad range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Sample Meal Plan
                Here’s an example of how a day’s meals could look:<br>

                Breakfast:<br>

                Oatmeal with a scoop of protein powder, a handful of berries, and a tablespoon of almond butter.
                3 boiled eggs for added protein.<br><br>
                Lunch:<br>

                Grilled chicken breast or tofu stir-fried with mixed vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, carrots) and a serving of quinoa or brown rice.
                Drizzle with olive oil for healthy fats.<br><br>
                Snack:<br>

                Greek yogurt with chia seeds and a banana or apple for fiber and energy.
                Dinner:

                Baked salmon or lean beef with roasted sweet potatoes, steamed asparagus, and a side salad with mixed greens, cucumbers, and a vinaigrette dressing.
                Evening Snack (optional):

                Cottage cheese with a few nuts or a slice of whole-grain toast with avocado if you need additional calories.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. Additional Tips
                Hydration: Aim for at least 2–3 liters of water per day, more if you're training intensely.
                Timing: Space meals every 3–4 hours to maintain energy levels and provide a steady flow of nutrients.
                Adjust According to Progress: Track your weight and body measurements every few weeks. If you’re not seeing progress, adjust your calorie intake slightly.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. Supplementation (Optional)
                Protein Powder: To meet protein goals if difficult through food alone.
                Creatine: For strength and muscle gains, especially beneficial in calisthenics.
                Multivitamin and Omega-3s: To cover any nutrient gaps and support heart and joint health.
